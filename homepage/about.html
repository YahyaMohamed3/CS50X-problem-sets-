                <h3>About me</h3>
                <hr>
                <p> Greetings, everyone! I extend a warm welcome to you all; I am Yahya Mohamed, and I am excited to invite you into my virtual realm. Navigating the intricate landscape of high school, my journey is propelled by an ardent passion for both computer science and the exhilarating world of powerlifting.</p>

                  <p>Throughout the years, I have immersed myself in the realm of powerlifting, achieving significant milestones that fill me with a profound sense of accomplishment. My commitment to the study of computer science knows no boundaries, as I delve into various fields, earnestly searching for my true calling. Whether I am engrossed in the intricacies of coding or pushing my physical limits in the realm of powerlifting, my overarching goal remains consistentâ€”to give my absolute best and consistently strive for excellence.</p>

                  <p>Beyond the confines of textbooks and algorithms, you are likely to find me deeply engaged in the world of powerlifting, deftly balancing the demands of my academic life and drawing inspiration from the seemingly mundane moments that surround me. Why the fascination with computer science, you might wonder? It is not merely a career choice; rather, it is an exploration of the future, particularly considering the pervasive influence of artificial intelligence. I derive immense joy from both powerlifting and computer science, consistently seeking new avenues for improvement in both realms.</p>

                  <p>This website functions as a virtual portal through which I aim to share the intricacies of my journey, my reflections, and the invaluable lessons I have gleaned along the way. My hope is that you, the visitor, will discover something within these virtual pages that piques your interest, imparts new knowledge, or simply brings a smile to your face..</p>

                  <p>Cheers,
                  Yahya Mohamed</p>
